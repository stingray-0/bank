Once upon a time, there was a man named tree. He always writes C++ code that people cannot understand, weird syntax, bad spacings, simple logics can be complicated by this tree guy and worst of all he is never online. He is just nonchalant about all the work he does.

edit: 
Why the fuck do people think im just here to have fun, like BITCH this aint summer camp, you got us doing codeforces at 8am while you sip coffee and pretend this isnt psychological warfare. "Whos excited to be here today?!" NO ONE not a single soul.
The only thing im excited for is to rot in peace not doing shit, im TIreD. My brain is having quarter a battery and you got the nerve to say "implementation time" with a goofy ahh smile. What the fuck is wrong with you. and dont say its only 5 problems. BITCH.
thats just 5 chances for me to realize i can't write shit. ALSO STOP WALKING AROUND THE ROOM. HOVERING OVER ME LIKE IM GONNA CHEAT ON SOME STUPID ASS PROBLEM I DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND go sit your scoreboard ass down and let me fail in peace.
and the schedule doesnt mean anything APPARENTLY. cuz when it rings you still talking talking talking. like its a fucking podcast. im not here cuz i wanna be. im here cuz truancy laws exit. and if i miss im getting punched into the next district.
